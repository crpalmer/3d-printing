m106 - need to change to m950
m305 - need to define heater and then reference heater
m558 - need to redo anyway for the bltouch on taz6!
       add C to specify the input pin and optionally the modulation pin
       P4 should be either P5 (filtered) or P8 (unfiltered)
       if you need pullup add '^' before the pin name
m574 - use a separate M574 for each axis
       need to name the pin to be used
       S0 becomes "!pin.name"
